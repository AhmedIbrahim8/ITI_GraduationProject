# Firm-Ware Over The Air (FOTA)
## 1 FOTA
Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) in embedded systems allows wireless deployment of firmware updates, improvements, bug fixes, and new features to devices after they have been deployed in the field, enhancing the efficiency and reliability.
### FOTA Features
1-Check for Update:
Determine the availability of newer firmware versions from the server (Firebase).
2- Get the Update from the Server:
This process encompasses establishing a secure connection, downloading the firmware update package, and validating the version of the downloaded update.
3- Encryption:
Implemented Fernet encryption as an advanced security measure, creating a unique code accessible only to your device and the server.
4- Error Handling: 
Implement error handling mechanisms to retry downloads, validate firmware integrity, and handle communication failures.
