# Firm-Ware Over The Air (FOTA)
## 1 FOTA
Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) in embedded systems allows wireless deployment of firmware updates, improvements, bug fixes, and new features to devices after they have been deployed in the field, enhancing the efficiency and reliability.
### FOTA Features
1-Check for Update:<br />
Determine the availability of newer firmware versions from the server (Firebase).<br />
2- Get the Update from the Server:<br />
This process encompasses establishing a secure connection, downloading the firmware update package, and validating the version of the downloaded update.<br />
3- Encryption:<br />
Implemented Fernet encryption as an advanced security measure, creating a unique code accessible only to your device and the server.<br />
4- Error Handling:<br /> 
Implement error handling mechanisms to retry downloads, validate firmware integrity, and handle communication failures.<br />
5- Flash the Code on the Device:<br /> 
involves the process of writing the new firmware onto the device's memory, replacing the existing code with the updated version seamlessly and reliably.<br /> 
6- Improvements in Performance:<br /> 
This feature ensures the continuous improvement of the device's operational stability and reliability through firmware updates.<br /> 

Each of these features is instrumental in orchestrating a secure, systematic, and efficient FOTA update process, fostering the reliability, security, and enhanced performance of electronic devices.<br />
